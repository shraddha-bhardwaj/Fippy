This project is based on Huffman Coding, a lossless, bottom-up compression algorithm.
It can compress and decompress any text files.


Implementation in Project
This project supports two functions:
1) Encode: Compresses input file passed.
2) Decode: Decompresses Huffman coded file passed back to its original file.


To run this project you need to create an executable file. 
You can follow the steps given below:

1) For compressing:

2) For Decompressing:

Example: inputFile.txt (2.07 MB) is compressed to compressedFile.huf (1.09 MB) file and decompressed back to ouputFile.txt (2.07 MB).

Result: This project is just an implementation of Huffman coding, it is not as efficient as the compression algorithm used currently to compress files.
